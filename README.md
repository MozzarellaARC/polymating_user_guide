Hello, MozzarellaARC here, we have finally come to the release of version 1.0.

Let's get started!!!

1. 
In Polymating 1.0 you have 4 main projection type to help your Retopology tasks we call them *solver*

Now let's take a closer look;
***"Force Project"***, this is an original projection type that have been used for polymating 1.0 and below and this is the first of its kind, it forces all vertices to project to the reference surface on the go.
***On-hit Limit*** similar to Force Project, except that it doesn't force all vertices on start, limit constraints only happens when the vertex hits the reference surface
***On-hit*** this is the bread and butter of Polymating 1.0 there is no actual projection but instead its only behavior is preventing the vertices to penetrates through the reference surface
***Multi-hit*** similar to On-hit, but it uses all the object in a collection as reference
