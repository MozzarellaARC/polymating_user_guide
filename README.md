# ***Polymating User Guide for 1.0***
### _A page for user instructions and manuals_

Hello, MozzarellaARC here, we have finally come to the release of version 1.0.
For this version of Polymating, same as before Sharky will help us guide version 1.0 [Plushie Shark made by QuazrSCI](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/plushie-shark-875414d5e45c42f9a5323ba8a8beed19) please say hello to Sharky!

Let's get started!!!

# _Basics and Workflows_

The typical workflow when you use Polymating is set up your reference mesh, creates your retopology object with basic shapes, apply overlay material to help you see better, and then shapes your retopology object, the image bellow will help you understands the basic principle of using Polymating

# _Installation and Settings UI_

Before we continue, I'm gonna introduce you to the ui of Polymating. The installation of Polymating will be pretty straight forward, after you download Polymating you can go to Edit > Preferences > Install > select the Polymating zip. file you have downloaded > Press the install add-on button > and turn on the check button, now that you've installed Polymating 0.5x you will be shown the preferences ui like this :

# _The Main UI_

Next up is the main ui of polymating that you will be seeing on the 3D viewport region, make sure to press N on your keyboard to open up the region ui, after that select the Polymating tab on the side to show this ui:

In Polymating 0.51.x the addon now has 2 main functionality which is the main operator that does the wrapping for retopology and overlay, The main button has different behavior from the previous versions of Polymating :
1. Polymating Operator will not stop automatically on different state of object visibility
2. Polymating Operator can now automatically gives material overlay to the selected mesh upon pressing "Start Polymating"

Please keep in mind that applying overlay will overwrites existing materials, also the overlay mechanics has its own behavior :
1. Applying overlay will automatically turn on the state of "In Front", "Wireframe", "Backface Culling"
2. When using automatic "Apply on start", the overlay will not be removed automatically upon stopping Polymating
3. Please keep in mind.

Prety simple right, now that you know the ui. Let's take a closer look on a simple example how you can start retopology with Polymating!!

# _Retopology object_

After you get comfortable with the ui now let's sets up a basic scene to use Polymating with [Plushie Shark made by QuazrSCI](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/plushie-shark-875414d5e45c42f9a5323ba8a8beed19) as our reference, and then let's creates a simple shape for the Retopology object like this:

# _The Wrapping_
Ok Now the next part is kinda scary but, don't be afraid. Because if you have already experience retopologizing with Shrinkwrap Modifier before, then it would look similar, the below video is how the wrapping started when you are in the state of Polymating and this is where the magic happens.

# The _Retopology_
Now that you have everything set, you can go to sculpt mode or edit mode whichever you prefer and then do the Retopology, like this:

Now this is not the only way to use Polymating, one of the other way to use it is by using it in edit mode with the "Proportional Editing" turned on, and I usually do this when there is a specific details that I need to tackle. Like this :

https://github.com/MozzarellaARC/PolymatingUserGuide/assets/62471068/c10ebe0f-d7d6-4ec5-866d-5c114a5dfd0c

But remember it was suppose to work with most of the Blender proprietary / primitive tool, so you could experiment with the other tool not mentioned on the guide. This guide just show which tool is mostly used by me.
_Have fun with the addon :D_

Goodbye [Sharky](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/plushie-shark-875414d5e45c42f9a5323ba8a8beed19) !!!
